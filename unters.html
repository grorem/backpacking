								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>While</call2> on my backpacking trip through Europe, I stopped in on Salzburg, Austria for a few days. I was travelling solo, but I would often find people to hang out with.
								One such person was Brodie from Australia. He and I started talking when I saw him wearing a sweatshirt with the flag of my home state of California on it, and I asked if he was from there.
								Alas, he was not, but Australia is a cool place, and he a really chill dude. We decided that we wanted to do something epic the next day, and we figured it would be great fun to find a local 
								mountain to hike up and spend a day doing that. Plus we were near the Austrian alps afterall. Why should we ever miss this opportunity. The most well known and accessible one was Untersberg, a mountain massif of the Berchtesgaden Alps which has one part in Austria and the other in Germany, and so we chose that one for the next day's adventure.

						<div class="span10">
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Now</call2>, we knew what direction it was in, as we could see it, but we didn't know exactly how to get there. Putting my German skills to good use, I asked in a local shop and we were told to take the 21 bus,
						or something like that, to Glenegg and get off there, and the trailhead would be very close to that bus stop. Once there, we started walking east, in what turned out to be the wrong diretion for the 
						trailhead, but I soon asked a man standing in front of a military station type place, and even thought my German isn't terrible, the Austrian accent was throwing me off a bit. After listening to this guy
						say some things, Brodie asked me if I knew what he said, and I truthfully said, "his accent kinda threw me off, but what I did get was that it is the other way down the road, then to the left, and we will
						see a bridge or something and then after the bridge left is the hard way and right is an easier way, or was it the other way around."

						<div class="span6">
							&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Either</call2> my German was good enough to get us to the destination, or we were lucky. Well, we found the bridge, but there was a gate closed across it. 
							We could see the trail that leads to the trailhead on the other side, but we found no other way around the fence and gate. So we hopped it, causing
							only minimal damage in the process, and soon we were on our way up the mountain. We soon ran into a few different people, including this one couple who informed us
							that we had indeed taken the harder route which apparently "requires alpine experience" in that one must be able to determine if a route is too icy to continue as 
							many have died along the way in ignorance of this. It was indeed true that there were those who had died along the way, every so often we would pass small shrines and
							plaques in the rock wall which were memorials to those who had slipped on the ice on the way up or down this mountain

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>We</call2> kept on hiking up, every now and then catching a glimpse of the cable car that took more flatland tourister types to the top. We didn't envy them at all as we
									got to enjoy seeing things one would miss from the cable car, such as these rocks painted with what I assume is an Austrian flag motif which marked the trail for a bit.

                            The Winds, or really the Wind River mountain range in Western Wyoming, has much to offer us in the way of backpacking. It simply cannot all be explored in even a lifetime.
							This trip will be a 4-5 day, 23.4 mile loop starting at the Big Sandy trailhead at 42* 41' 16.98" N  109* 16' 11.76" W, going into an area known as the cirque of the towers, and then looping back around
