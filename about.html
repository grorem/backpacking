		<call2>Welcome,</call2>&nbsp I have been involved in adventuring in the outdoors in various capacities in the past, and I am always becoming ever passionate about exploration and adventure out-of-doors, as well as the in-of-cars
			as I really love road trips as well. Combinations of the two are often quite epic.				

This site primarily serves as a convinient staging point for information in a much more centralized and distilled form for me and my friends while preparing for backpacking trips than just 
posting links to great things on a Facebook groups page affords. You can also find some stories and descriptions of past trips I have been on and the things I have experienced along the way as well as many photos.						
<br /><br />
Each event, trip, or adventure has to it assigned different information, such as: The planning stages for upcoming trips, Classes of difficulty and hardcoreitude, as well as the date and location.
<br /><br />
					
	</div>			
		
		<div class="row">			
		<call2>Classes</call2> are along a continuum from whimpidite to rather hardcore starting with: <br /><br />
		
		<img src="image/dough.png">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call3>-Dough Boy-</call3><br /> 
			No more than an hour or so of mostly flat, paved pathway. Not likely we will see many of these on here, but I will include some from time to time to showcase some of my favorite local, easy trails. 
			<br /> <br /> 
			
		<img src="image/wknd.png">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call3>-Yuppie Hipster-</call3><br /> 
			In this class you'll find yourself on day hikes, day hiking out from a developed campsite at a National Park, or maybe as much as hiking out from a car, 
			home, or base camp and staying out for a night or two in a non-real-wilderness area to then return home. The physical and gear requirements are pretty chill seeing as how help isn't far away at all in these cases if something were to 
			go awry.<br /><br />
			
		<img src="image/ted.png">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call3>-Ted Nugent-</call3><br /> 
		Now we are getting into some actual backpacking. It could be for as little as one night out or as many as 3, but either way it involves traveling quite a ways out of 
		town and finding solitude from at least a full day's hiking distance from where you parked. The max altitude encountered will remain under 10,000ft in this class, but more consideration has to be taken for how much farther away help is now in this class, proper food storage
		due to increased wildlife activity, and competence with navigation tools and fire creating abilities become a bit more important. 
			<br /> <br /> 
			
		<img src="image/grizz.png">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call3>-Grizzly Adams-</call3><br /> 
		
				This class goes over 10,000ft. and involves 3&nbsp&nbsp+ nights of straight backcountry camping. One really needs to be able to navigate more than in the Nugent class. there is often little or no facilities for many miles, and 
				you are traveling in areas where dangerous wildlife and defense from such are important considerations.<br /><br /> 
		
		<img src="image/hillary.png">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call3>-Sir Edmund Hillary-</call3><br />
		
			Let's face it, he and Tenzing Norgay being the first guys recorded to have summited Everest makes him a boss. So shall the prerequisites for this class be, and they are actually kinda simple. 
			It involves being involved in the activities of the aforementioned classes, yet that require mountaineering equipment (Crampons, Ice axes, and all those ropes and metal hangy things.) to be busted 
			out above 10,000ft. Then if one does this in a multi-day capacity over 12,000ft, it is to be of the class <call3>"Sir Edmund Hillary&nbsp&nbsp+"</call3>
			Getting even more hardcore? Well, above 15,000ft is <call3>"Sir Edmund Hillary&nbsp&nbsp++"</call3> and over 20,000ft, you get the idea.<br /><br />
			
			
		- There is also a "special teams" class for things that are way rad, but without relevance to difficulty like roadtrips and europe backpacking for example.<br />	<br />
		
		<call2>Stages</call2> are as follows along a spectrum from least prepared to already gone and traveling: <br />
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- <call3>nebulous idea</call3>&nbsp - &nbsp<call3>insurretion fomenting</call3>&nbsp -&nbsp <call3>Active Prep</call3>
&nbsp - &nbsp<call3>T.minus</call3>, and - <call3>see y'all later!</call3>	<br />

                            The Winds, or really the Wind River mountain range in Western Wyoming, has much to offer us in the way of backpacking. It simply cannot all be explored in even a lifetime.
							This trip will be a 4-5 day, 23.4 mile loop starting at the Big Sandy trailhead at 42* 41' 16.98" N  109* 16' 11.76" W, going into an area known as the cirque of the towers, and then looping back around
							behind to the first campsite.
