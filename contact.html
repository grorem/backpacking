										<call2>Gear:</call2><br />

										This subject reminds me of a guy with whom I chatted while in a hostel bar in Prague. He is a wilderness rescue worker in Washington state, and the wilderness being a mutual passion, we of course talked on this subject.
							I particularly remember the multiple stories he had of going out to rescue people who were in dire straits only because of underpreparation. One such story included an overweight man being rescued 
							from the forests off Washington highway 2 who was found wearing shorts, a beater, and crocks while sitting on the ground eating a snickers. No compass, map, even inadiquate gps, nothing. 
							I almost couldn't believe that someone of sound mental health, if only determined by want of any indication of insanity, would trek miles like this in the colder season completely unprepared.
							But my new buddy of the hostel bar didn't have just this story, he had too many to be able to fit into that evening.
							
							<br /><br />
							
							Alas, one's gear is an important consideration in preparation for a trip. Just what gear to bring can depend on the person, but for an overnight trip, each should at least bring 
							the following items, while keeping in mind that less is always more in the way of comfort 
							and enjoyment. I always find people often over pack, and I have done this myself as well. While not being an ultralight backpacker, I try to abide by 
							a self-coined principle which I have given as advice before one should undertake either traveling through Europe or dating: "Just as you feel you are ready to go, cut your 
							baggage in half, and double your money."
							That being said, here is a general list to get one started. I consider this adequate for a Grizzly Adams class trip; with the proper 
							ammount of food and water being adjusted for duration.<br /><br /> Click on each of the listed items to cause a discussion of that item to appear below.

											<call2>Fitness:</call2><br />
											One should take this seriously as even if one is already decently fit, more never hurts, as it will only improve your enjoyment. 
													If one finds he or she is out of shape, and no attention to improvement is given before the trip, he is likely to find himself in greater discomfort than otherwise would be necessary
													and even liable to holding up the group, especially during trips classed Ted Nugent and higher. The prep page offers a fitness section talking about it.<br /><br />

											<call2>Weather:</call2><br />
											
											Know before you go. Knowing the weather conditions is incredibly important. In high altitude areas in Wyoming for example, snow storms can happen in the middle of summer. I have had to decide against doing hikes which I was looking forward to for many months
											knowing that the weather conditions were too dangerous for the group's skill level, experience, and equipment.<br /><br />

											<call2>Wildlife:</call2><br />
											
											One has to take the local wildlife into consideration. Everything from squirrels to Grizzly bears is after food, and humans trekking into the wilderness often bring with them
											an irresistable source of easy food, or at least what smells like it. Some encounters can make for some silly stories like a group member yelling at marmots while he was startled by one while making use of "the office", and others
											can be dangerous and downright life threatening. Defense from unwanted wildlife encounters, regardless of the severity of the threat on one's life, starts with using your brain.
											Keep food out of your tent! always always this. Don't mix that last protein shake before bed, in fact, keep the water bottle you mixed it in during the day in the bag hangin' from the tree away from camp too.
											Hungry animals like bears can really smell such things from miles away, and keeping your food near your camp, or even worse, in your tent<br /><br />
											
											Most important piece of gear you must always take with you, your brain. While people will freak out over bears, and bears are dangerous, more people die each year in Yellowstone National Park from either drowning or bison than from bear.  
											But in such a rare case of a truly dangerous encounter, just what means of defence someone choses to protect himself and group members during a dangerous encounter is a heavily debated subject. 
											Many will say that all one needs is avoidance. Many of these principles are great and do go a long way in avoiding a dangerous situation; however, some encounters have occured where
											the dangerous animal (Bear, Moose, Bison) has attacked and in some cases killed someone, completely unprovoked, as they are indeed wild animals and often ornery and unpredictable. In other cases, people
											have even been killed by dangerous wildlife which were not aggressive. Polar bears, for example, are very curious by nature and often haven't ever seen a human before. How do these enormous and powerful preadetors
											often figure out what something is? By killing it. It's just how they work. As such, many people opt to take along bear spray for those big critters, and others supplement this with a firearm and the skills to use it. 
											Whatever choice you make, make it prudent to the situation and wilderness in which you are trekking.
