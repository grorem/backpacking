							&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>The Wind Rivers</call2> mountain range in Western Wyoming has much to offer us in the way of backpacking. 
							It is so vast that it simply cannot all be explored in even a lifetime. I have always wanted to see the famed "Cirque of the Towers" and decided it was time.
							This trip will be a 4-5 day, 23.4 mile loop starting at the Big Sandy trailhead at 42* 41' 16.98" N 109* 16' 11.76" W, going into an area known as the cirque of the towers, and then looping back 
							around behind to the first campsite.

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Here</call2> is a map of the proposed route. We will be going counter-clockwise. Put your mouse cursor over this image to change it into a 3D satellite map.

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>The</call2> first night will be spent at that first campsite with the option of maybe even spending a day extra to help acclimate ourselves to the altitude if anyone seems to be having trouble at first,
								as it starts out just above 9,100ft and only goes up from there with a planned max altitude of 12,500ft.<br />
							
							
							
								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Next,</call2> we will make our way Northeast along big sandy lake until turning North to go up and over into the cirque itself. 
								We will then camp somewhere around here and spend a day fishing and climbing nearby mitchell peak which is at 12,500ft, yet is easily accessed by non-technical means.
							
							
							
								That's right, I said fishing. Bring poles, as the trout fishing in this area is extraordinarily great, and we will be sure to take advantage of this. When I fished in this range before, I felt like I could have tied on my multitool and still have been pulling them out all day, and fresh caught trout cooked at camp is epic tasty.
							<br />
							 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>We</call2> shall continue our way along west up and over jackass pass, which is apparently rugged enough to be just impassible for horses and mules. No problem though. 
							We will continue on as we now turn west and eventually hike another day
							away and find another place to make camp.<br />
							
							&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Continuing</call2> along in the same fashion, hiking a good bit from morning 'til afternoon and maybe taking fishing time in the afternoons.
							  We then turn southward and eventually back to the first camp where we will camp one more night until packing it all up in the morning and start heading home.
							  The westerly car, now turned easterly, will drop folks off at SLC intl.

							That is the general plan at least, small detours to see other nearby things and fish in other lakes can and will probably be made.<br />
