						<call2>Fasten</call2> your seatbelts, this is gonna be a long one. I have always loved traveling, and before this trip have never been to Europe. I always wanted to do a big backpacking across europe trip with a group of friends, but past plans always
						seemed to fall through.
						
						My opportunity came in the form of a volunteer program, Lifenets, who sponsored myself and others in a small group to teach English and help run a daycamp type operation for disadvantaged children in western Ukraine.

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Once</call2> packed, the trip really began. I chose my external frame backpack, as I had recently aquired it off ebay and wanted to
								break it in. Plus it was kinda neat to have an older style pack which stood out with a sort of vintage flair among the usual packs of other travelers. After taking off from San Francisco, my 
								first stop was in New York for a night and most of the next day. I flew into La Guardia and took the bus into Harlem, where I then took a southward bus into Manhattan to meet
								up with my friend Ariel, who was way nice and had a couch on which I was able to crash for the night. But before crashing, we decided to go out and have some fun exploring a bit of Manhattan.
								I actually needed to pick up an IPod touch, and as it was getting late (11pm), I asked Ariel if there were any 24 hour Apple stores in Manhattan, and she answered me with a look of surprise, as
								if there were any question. it IS New York City afterall.

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>After</call2>  taking off from San Francisco, my 
								first stop was in New York for a night and most of the next day. I flew into La Guardia and took the bus, being driven by a very disgruntled and erratic bus driver, into Harlem where I saw 
								a guy looking into the bus, pointing at random people as it drove by, and gave the cut throught hand gesture. I also ran into some nice people with whom I chatted, and as I got off the bus, the disgruntled
								cussing bus driver got off his shift, and between his obcenities and irate demeanor, I said, "thanks man" and he suddenly smiled and said, "no problem at all, have a good one!", and went
								right back to his prior attitude. At least he doesn't displace his anger on others I suppose. I then took a southward bus into Manhattan to meet

						<div class="span6">
								Touch at the 24 hour apple store at something like 2am. The next day Ariel and I explored some more. Bagels, Central Park wandering, Battery park and a few other places until about 2pm when I had to make my way
								via subway and air train to JFK intl. where my Swiss Airlines flight would take me to Geneva, Swizerland for a 12 hour layover. I planned such a layover because there wasn't avoiding a layover for the price I got my tickets,
								and this way I would arrive in Geneva at 9am and depart at 8:45pm, giving
								me ample daylight time to explore the city some. Passport, Bording passes, and Ipod in hand, I sat and waiting for my flight to Geneva.
								The flight departed at around 6pm, and I had a rather squished flight on the way over. I was in coach of course, and I was in the middle section in one of the two middle seats with a very large man on my right. It was kinda rough, but
								my excitement kept me going.

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Europe!</call2> I had landed and managed to make my way from the airport to the center of Geneva. This is the first photo I took in Europe, and
								although I was quite tired from the trip, I didn't feel it much from the excitement of exploring my first European city. You can see the Jet D'eau (jet of water) shootin' up in the background behind that
								gazebo thing in the photo to the left. I soon found a nice park bench on the other side of Lac Leman (the name of the big lake there), and I sat there for a bit just taking it in. In curiosity,
								I whipped out the IPod, and lo and behold wouldn't ya know, there was internet. So I tinkered with that for a bit, sending emails back home and whatnot. I then wandered around for a bit in a sort of
								dream state of not fully quite grasping that I was really in Europe. I thought perhaps this was a sign that I was really too tired for health and should find a nice bench somewhere and take a nap. So I did.
								I found what had become my favorite fountain in the world. I had my small day pack and water bottle which I so wisely decided to take with me for the day, but I soon had drained

					</div>

						<div class="span10">
								 its contents and was wanting
								something to drink. Rather than blow 5 Swiss Francs (something like 6 bucks) on a small bottle of water, I went up to a suspicious jet of water coming out of some rock above which was a small plaque on which was
								some kind of perculiar scribbling. Aha! French! It said "Eau Potable", and based on my very rudimentary French, the fact that Swizerland didn't strike me as a third world country where the water would
								be assumed to be quite sketchy, and	combined with my thirst, I took a bold step and decided I could drink the water.

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>My</call2> short time in Swizerland was coming to a close, and so I headed back to the airport, and while waiting for my flight to Berlin, I tried to
								take a nap on some of the hardest, most horridly uncomfortable seat/bench things in the world. I imagine they were so purposely designed to prevent what I was trying, and actually did manage, to do. During my flight on Lufthansa, I seemed to look the part of a German,
								so the flight attendants asked me for my food option in whatnot in German and didn't seem to notice or care about my accent or maybe lack thereof. Then the guy next to me started talking with me in German.
								we carried conversation for a bit until I realized that his accent, while not bad, wasn't German. So I asked where he was from. Turns out he was from Hawaii and so we decided English would work just fine. During this flight, 
								the pilot kept us all updated on the current Italy vs. Germany semifinal match of the European soccer cup in Ukraine.

								&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Deutschland!!</call2> This is what I heard by many a chant and song of drunken soccer fans when I was on the streets of Berlin in search of my hostel.
								I had landed right at sunset, and I had a pretty sweet view of Berlin on the way into Tiegel airport in the north of the city. I managed to pull some cash out of the ATM (ugh.. Euros...), and I got on the TXL bus 
								towards Alexanderplatz.(not before helping some Aussies select English on the ticket machine). The bus meandered through the streets for a time until we got close to Hochbahnhof station (The main station still north of
								Alexanderplatz), but we soon came to a stop. Traffic. There was epic congestion, and after some sitting around for a bit, the bus driver mumbled something incomprehensible to me, but also apparently to the locals, so I didn't
								feel too bad in not understanding, and just disappeared for about 15 minutes. He later retured and more coherently told us that the soccer celebration at the brandenburg gate had spilled out into the streets and was jamming everything up
								and that we would have to find alternate

								transportation via U-Bahn. I went into the Hochbahnhof station, but figured my hostel wasn't too far away really, so I decided to walk. About 30 minutes later, I finally arrived at the hostel at about 1am
								despite the drunken party going on in the streets which included some guy standing in the middle of traffic with his pants down while his friends laughed histarically. All this excitement, and as it turns out, the Germans lost the game, sending Italy to the
								finals and dear Deutschland to battle for third place. It was time for a good night's sleep, and lucky for me, despite it being around 11am or 2pm or something horrid like that back home, I hit the pillow and was out like a rock. So far my Europe adventure
								was pretty fun, and I was excited for tomorrow.

									&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<call2>Indeed</call2> it was exciting. I woke up and spent the few euros for the hostel breakfast. It was a buffet thing, so I got filled up with some pretty good stuff. I then

									in the south of Berlin (Flughafen Schönefeld). I was off to Budapest, Hungary where I would have an afternoon and the next day to myself until finally meeting up with the others in the Lifenets crew.

								looked impressive. I would often say, "ooh, there's a thing!" and take a picture of it. The thing that immediately impressed me about Budapest was the tremendous amount of these "things" I encountered. Even
								as I emerged from the subway from the airport, and for the first time saw the city, I was shocked at how many "things" there were. Everything was so old and big and cool lookin'.
