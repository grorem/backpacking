						<call2>G-Dub,</call2> (G for Greg and Dub for William) has had a long tradition of road trips. Just as we had taken Will's 5-speed saturn to Canada during the winter multiple times,
								we decided it was time for another road trip, however, during the summer this time in order to visit a good few national parks in the western US. The Parks we visited were
								Zion NP, Bryce Canyon NP, Capitol Reef NP, all in the state of Utah, Grand Teton NP in Wyoming, and Glacier NP in Montana.

					<div class="row">
						It started one evening while I was over at Will's place for dinner. He and his parents were conversing with me about different outdoors trips I have been on, and Will said something to the effect
						of, "man.. next time you go on one of these, you have to take me." At that moment, I immediately decided a summer trip of some sort was going to happen and of course his, then fiance, now wife Alina
						would be included. I immediately texted her to let her know of the idea as she is an adventurous type and can be awesomely gung-ho when it comes to these kinds of trips. The trip was still months away, and we
						started planning and preparing until finally, in late July, the time had come to depart.

							I wanted to show them some of the amazing places to which I had been the following year on another trip, and also get to explore some new areas as well. So I suggested this itinerary
							and all felt it was good, as everyone else hadn't been to most of these places before. The places mentioned above which we visited (and on the map) were not all which we had planned, however.
							We had also planned to go into the Wind Rivers range for a few days to see the Cirque of the Towers and do some extra looking around in Yellowstone before heading on to Glacier NP in Montana.
							But the certain plans fell flat due to unforseen events.

							Anyway, more on that later, and so the trip began!

							The group at this point had grown to 4 people after we picked up Alexes, another friend who we met while volunteering at a youth camp a few weeks before, and this just about maxed out Will's small saturn.

                            The Winds, or really the Wind River mountain range in Western Wyoming, has much to offer us in the way of backpacking. It simply cannot all be explored in even a lifetime.
							This trip will be a 4-5 day, 23.4 mile loop starting at the Big Sandy trailhead at 42* 41' 16.98" N  109* 16' 11.76" W, going into an area known as the cirque of the towers, and then looping back around
							behind to the first campsite.
